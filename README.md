# PyVidDown
PyVidDown is a simple, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for downloading YouTube videos using Python. This app was built because I was struggling to find a good YouTube video downloader that was easy to use and didn't require me to go through complicated command-line interfaces.

Features
PyVidDown comes with a range of features that make it easy to download YouTube videos, including:

A simple, intuitive GUI that makes it easy to copy and paste YouTube video links
The ability to download videos in the highest resolution
Fast, reliable downloads using the popular PyTube library
Easy-to-read logs that show you the progress of your downloads
